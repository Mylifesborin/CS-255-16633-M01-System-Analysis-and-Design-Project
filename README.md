DriverPass Project

DriverPass needed a system to help students prepare for their driving tests with online practice exams and lesson scheduling. It’s designed to work on any device and handle scheduling, progress tracking, and different roles for students, secretaries, and admins.

What Went Well
I did a good job laying out clear requirements and using diagrams to make the system easy to understand and build.

What I’d Revise
I’d add more detail to the UI section, maybe some mock-ups, to give a clearer picture of the user experience.

Understanding User Needs
I focused on the specific needs of students, secretaries, and admins to ensure the system made sense for everyone. Meeting user needs keeps the system practical and user-friendly.

Design Approach and Future Strategies
I start by gathering requirements and using diagrams to plan. Next time, I’ll add more feedback loops, agile methods, and regular testing to keep things user-focused and catch issues early.
